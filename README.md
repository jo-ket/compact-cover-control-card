## Special Features

### Customizable Position Control
All three quick action buttons can now be customized:

- **Sun icon (‚òÄÔ∏è)** - Configurable `sun_position` (default: 100%)
- **Sun-with-clouds icon (‚õÖ)** - Configurable `middle_position` (default: 50%)  
- **Moon icon (üåô)** - Configurable `moon_position` (default: 0%)

Each position follows the same hierarchy:
1. Cover-specific setting (highest priority)
2. Room-level setting
3. Card-level setting  
4. Built-in default (lowest priority)

This allows you to:
- Set different "fully open" positions for different types of covers
- Have partial closing positions that still provide privacy
- Accommodate covers that shouldn't go to 100% or 0% due to mechanical constraints

### Lux-Based Automation
The card supports built-in lux-based automation for covers, allowing them to respond automatically to changing light conditions:

- Can be configured at card, room, or cover level
- Supports multiple rules with different conditions
- Rules are evaluated in order (cover-specific rules first)
- First matching rule is applied
- Positions are only changed when needed (checks current position)
- Time constraints allow for daylight/evening-specific behaviors
- Automations only run when relevant sensor values change

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Closing blinds during bright sunlight to prevent overheating
- Opening blinds when light levels are comfortable
- Closing blinds in the evening when it gets dark
- Creating different behaviors for different times of day

### KNX Integration
The `invert_percentage` option is particularly useful for KNX installations where the cover percentage is inverted compared to Home Assistant's standard (in KNX, 0% typically means fully open, while in Home Assistant 0% means fully closed). Enable this option to match your KNX cover behavior while maintaining an intuitive user interface.

### Lock Functionality
The `lock_entity` option allows you to disable cover controls based on the state of another entity. This is useful for:
- Weather protection (disable controls during high winds)
- Safety interlocks (prevent operation when windows are open)
- Child safety (disable specific covers when needed)
- Maintenance mode

The cover controls will be disabled when the lock entity state is 'on'.

### Position Control
- Room-level quick actions (‚òÄÔ∏è, ‚õÖ, üåô) control all covers in the room
- Individual sliders provide fine-grained control
- All positions (sun, middle, moon) are customizable at card, room, or cover level
- Visual gradient indicates current position with blue (closed) to yellow (open) transition
